1. How do I approach designing software?
While working on this project, I have learned a lot about rendering and creating 3D objects within Visual Studios. In this project, I used a few different design features. Phong Lighting was one as well as rendering textures and shaders. When looking at future projects, I believe a lot of what I could take from this is that time management is important. Being able to have extra time on certain parts would have been helpful for me then and probably into the future.
2. How do I approach developing programs?
I don't think I learned many new strategies, but I do know that every little thing needs to be tested. Even if it's a color or a texture binding. It needs to be tested. From the beginning, Each milestone project was built on concepts. With new features to add, there were adjustments to make that could have posed challenges. I do think that learning the basics was very helpful to work later on down the road.
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Creating visualizations involves solving challenging problems related to data and algorithms. These problem-solving skills are applicable in future courses, including computer science and software engineering. In a professional setting, the ability to create data visualizations is important for understanding and explaining data information. Computational graphics skills would allow professionals to create visual representations, charts, and interactive displays for data analysis.
